# Flow routing aiming load balancing and path length in multi-hop networks with different link qualities

This work involves an exact bi-objective approach for simultaneously minimizing the total cost of flow routing and the network bottleneck when link qualities and flow weights are relevant.
Here we make available the source code and the main results obtained in the work. We also make available additional that are not available in the paper. While these results do not add relevant information to the work, they extend sensibly the computational evaluation.
